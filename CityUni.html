                    <h3>Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis</h3>
                    <p>The aim of the project was to provide a tool for automating product review analysis and extracting business insights from fine-grained sentiment analysis. The pipeline consists of two models, one responsible for identifying opinion targets and the other responsible for labelling the sentiment expressed towards that target. Opinion targets are product or service features, which customers provide feedback on through their reviews. Multiple pre-trained transformer-based models, such as BERT and RoBERTa were fine-tuned on two distinct domain, laptops, and restaurants, as well as a combination of the two.</p>

                    <h3>Hate Speech Tweet Classification</h3>
                    <p>In this solo project, I developed an AI/ML model to detect and classify tweets as either offensive/hateful or neutral, addressing the growing need for automated moderation on social media platforms. The model is designed to help mitigate the spread of harmful content, making online spaces safer for users.</p>
                    <p>Using Python as the primary programming language, I utilized libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, NLTK for natural language processing, and TensorFlow for model training. Through pre-processing techniques like tokenization and stop-word removal, I optimized the data for accurate classification. I experimented with different neural network architectures, including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models, fine-tuning hyperparameters to achieve high accuracy and reduce false positives.</p>
                    <p>This project provided hands-on experience in the end-to-end development of an NLP-based AI model, from data cleaning and feature engineering to model evaluation. The final model serves as a foundation for real-world applications in content moderation and demonstrates the impact of AI in promoting safer online communities.</p>
